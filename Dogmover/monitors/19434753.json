While they can still apply, they may have a partially filled out application. This can create inequity in the hiring process.\nTo rectify this, find the associated Bugsnag to determine the student and application affected. From there, work with a PM to help the student fill out the rest of the questions for the employer.\n\n@slack-emp-ats-alerts,@slack-incidents-te-analytics-int",
