A fielddata circuit breaker is triggered if a query tries to load fielddata that would require over 60 percent of the heap.\n\nWhat caused this error? Was this a one-time query, or one that we run frequently?\n\nWe might need to increase the size of our ES cluster.\n\n@slack-incidents-emp-integ-analytics,@slack-incidents-te-analytics-int",
