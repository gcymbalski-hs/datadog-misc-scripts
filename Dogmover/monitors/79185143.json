The hope is that k8s does not need to restart pods, but this appears to now be happening.\nPlease do the following:\n- If you have permissions, go ahead and [scale down the pods](https://joinhandshake.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CE/pages/2462711869/How+to+Manually+Scale+a+Kubernetes+Deployment+or+Pods) to 0 to disable this deployment.\n- Create a PR in ops that scales down the deployment. It will be the same as [this](https://github.com/joinhandshake/ops/pull/3251). Get this merged as soon as possible. Otherwise, when the app deploys our manual scaling down changes will be overwritten.\n\nReach out to Chris Rolfs for help.\n @slack-incidents-platform-services,@slack-incidents-humans",
